The graph works kind of, but the points are super strong forced to the hex grid and then after a few seconds, this error appears:

TypeError: Failed to execute 'createLinearGradient' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The provided double value is non-finite.

Fix: make the distortion field less strong; base it's force on construction on a physical-unit-equivalent of variable that other parameters of the graph movement are based on also so that tuning gets easier. think of a clever physics-related ways of binding many parameters together. in extreme cases, non-finite values can appear when dividing by zero or the like -- tuning parameters better should be able to avoid this pretty easily
