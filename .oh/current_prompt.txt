this website shows a CV and landing page for a developer looking for work. I really like the style! past projects cards are still not really filled with content (at least I see none, and in any case they seem a bit too small -- they should horizontally fill the screen and vary in height only, also be a bit playful in style. the overall style however should stay as is i.e. color scheme, landing page design; for the CV page I think bringing in the past project tiles is a good idea, best in code that is not duplicated with the landing page, but still allows differentiation in how it's displayed (e.g. size, style) in both places (-> don't abstract too hard, just formulaic change-resistant "summoning" of the desired page content re: past project tiles at that point in the code.
But first, all these things have to be filled with the right content for the CV (which still should be like a monolithic "paper" page, also in style and font, but with a discrete transition to the past projects part of the document where it should get a bit more playful with the tiles.

make the colorscheme of the landing page (blue/purple) and the CV page match more, by pulling it more into the gold / ochre / orange palette with one distinct contract color (e.g. dark, saturated green, and a light green also? make a color palette update and use it throughout the style!

The desired content of the cv is already in the proper CV tsx page. However, there are other regions of the page where it may be worth thinking about wording it more individually suited to the person of the CV, me. Stay professional always. A bit passion for programming is not wrong either, though.

The current occupation is moreover, "Spleenlab GmbH", "Software and Algorithms Engineer", "May 2023-Present", "Developing algorithms for autonomous systems and robotics, one standalone product and one successful complex algorithm transcription to C99 and complete coverage with tests"; before that: "Esslinger IT Consulting", "Project Lead JCrypTool, core development and dev-ops". Also adapt it so that it's clear that I'm not a student anymore but a professional with wide experience. make the "technical skills" section a bit less whimsy; my strengths are "devops, bash, C++, rust, C99, Scala 2/3, Java, GUI-frameworks, maven, docker, git, linux, software architecture" -- all these are proficient to expert. the second category should be the other keyword, but a bit boiled down.
