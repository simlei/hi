I want a style update for the website of this repo.

The page generated as a personal networking / CV github pages has been updated lately by introducing a fancy graph in the background, and has introduced assets like .png files, but it's not yet nicely done. Also, many of the information about the Curriculum Vita owner was lost in favor of John Doe.
Original CV info is still available in: /workspace/website/cv/index.html but it is not used. transfer and prune it.

Also, the style is kind of old fashioned. I want modern, clean top-to-bottom scrolling with the blurry graph covering most of the background. I want not that muted colors, but some from an alternative PaperColor palette, maybe with a twist (but well coordinated on a palette of colors inspired by a web search for a good template). I also want the CV page look not fully, but in overall font and underlining style, and document structure, like an old-fashioned CV. The project tiles then are a transition to a more modern part here, and the transition to the project cards should be smooth using modern next.js + consorts.

The landing page should have one friendly welcome sentence, a CV link somewhere in the top right, and state some of the contact details, and a link to a lorem ipsum "tile-blog" where there are two posts, both as big tiles that can be scrolled by, and slightly react to be in focus by color shading and code highlight activation.

I want that tested using /workspace/scripts/deploy.sh --dry-run.
