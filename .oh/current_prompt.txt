- scan /workspace/docs/index.md for a knowledge base of the website and how to test.

look at the visualization of the graph background. it is very very convoluted. try to keep it in principle the same -- display a graph with lively animation -- but re-implement it from scratch with that in mind only, and emulating the parameters to it in spirit. Keep the field distortion -- I want it however to also work in graph space, not in pixel/eventual position space, so if that does not work with the existing field implementation, refactor it minimally in that respect.  I want it so, that the graph distances are mapped to pixels/positions only where drawing is concerned. It is very important for the graph nodes to behave the same for every resolution of the website -- the graph space should be a square and should adapt in size to the page background area -- but if it's getting to slim a page, just overdraw to the left and right (this just as guidance on how to manage coordinates -- use a stable next.js paradigm that fits this use case best).

Also, implement a second node distortion field similar to how the one that currently exists (w.r.t. hex tiles), that slightly repulses nodes by mouse pointer movement. make it so that cursor position needs be updated from the outside in this field implementation. Make it so, that the mouse pointer is reset after a duration of 2s if no movement is registered.

All in all I expect a vastly trimmed down graph implementation that retains much of it's nice qualities.

test according to the docs at the end. do it all in one run by reading file you want to change, and scan also their dependencies that seem relevant to the task.
