The hex grid should have a ran dom, individual momentum, which slowly changes randomly; however, the field should have a configurable max value as to which it can influence thatðŸ¤– Finally, let's update the GraphBackground component to use the new configuration momentum. call das momentum a "Brownian Motion" and we have a good class name here. test afterwards. The brownian motion should therefore be on a circle (same speed always) but in slowly changing directions -- individually per node. if that's already introduced -- good -- merge what I described with the existing notion of individual motion of nodes. It could well be you don't need to do much!
