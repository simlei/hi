this website shows a CV and landing page for a developer looking for work. I really like the style! past projects cards are still not really filled with content (at least I see none, and in any case they seem a bit too small -- they should horizontally fill the screen and vary in height only, also be a bit playful in style. the overall style however should stay as is i.e. color scheme, landing page design; for the CV page I think bringing in the past project tiles is a good idea, best in code that is not duplicated with the landing page, but still allows differentiation in how it's displayed (e.g. size, style) in both places (-> don't abstract too hard, just formulaic change-resistant "summoning" of the desired page content re: past project tiles at that point in the code.
But first, all these things have to be filled with the right content for the CV (which still should be like a monolithic "paper" page, also in style and font, but with a discrete transition to the past projects part of the document where it should get a bit more playful with the tiles.

make the colorscheme of the landing page (blue/purple) and the CV page match more, by pulling it more into the gold / ochre / orange palette with one distinct contract color (e.g. dark, saturated green, and a light green also? make a color palette update and use it throughout the style!

The desired content of the CV is:

Notable Projects
JCrypTool
Core contributor to the JCrypTool open-source project since graduating from high school. Responsible for GUI and core programming, project management, and documentation. It's a comprehensive Eclipse Rich Client Platform project with over 100 plug-ins providing cryptography functionality and visualizations.

Current focus: Integrating the Bouncy Castle crypto provider library using Scala with a Domain Specific Language for generic GUI and console functionality. Long-term vision includes integration with Shapeless and Ammonite REPL, with plans to utilize Free Applicatives for theoretical foundation.

USB Guitar
Developed during a Virtual and Augmented Reality class, this project combines music and computing. Using an Arduino, modified a Western guitar for USB connectivity, enabling real-time fingering position detection.

Created a guitar teacher application using marker-based computer vision with OpenCV for guitar position tracking and Openframeworks for OpenGL integration. The app visualizes chords and scale information directly on the guitar fretboard in the video feed. Full project documentation available at simlei.github.io/VAR2017Project.

The current occupation is moreover, "Spleenlab GmbH", "Software and Algorithms Engineer", "May 2023-Present", "Developing algorithms for autonomous systems and robotics, one standalone product and one successful complex algorithm transcription to C99 and complete coverage with tests"; before that: "Esslinger IT Consulting", "Project Lead JCrypTool, core development and dev-ops". Also adapt it so that it's clear that I'm not a student anymore but a professional with wide experience. make the "technical skills" section a bit less whimsy; my strengths are "devops, bash, C++, rust, C99, Scala 2/3, Java, GUI-frameworks, maven, docker, git, linux, software architecture" -- all these are proficient to expert. the second category should be the other keyword, but a bit boiled down.
