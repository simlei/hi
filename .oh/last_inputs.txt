 it must support this website.
ü§ñ I'll help you create a minimal CV website that's GitHub Pages compatible. Let me first check the content of the index.md file to understand what we're working with.

ü§ñ I see there's a reference to a CV prompt. Let me check that first.

all base dependencies required for building, checking if trheü§ñ I'll use a predefined muted color scheme based on Material Design principles. Let's create the website structure:

‚ùØ mkdir -p /workspace/website && cd /workspace/website && npm init -y && npm install next react react-dom @types/react @types/node typescript tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @headlessu
i/react @heroicons/react && npx create-next-app . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm

ey are already installed (clever bash-function +^[[32;2uargument passing exploitation, keeping it DRY, preferrably). if all prereqs are installed, good, proceed to build and launch the 
local webserver (must be cleaning up after itself on any kind of termination of the overarching script), exctract the URL^[[32;2u from it, and either print it to stdout (special flag) o

‚ùØ cd /workspace && npx create-next-app@latest website --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm

process, kind of guaranteeing proper dev workflow. durint all that and right now, commit the newest website source files to the git repo in /workspace/.git, continuing to follow /worksp
ace/docs instructions about working on the task (maybe docs need be expanded by the current prompt re:^[[32;2utesting). I'm looking forward to this neat script and changes, that keep in
 step with its surroundings (does nothing extreme to accomplish this)
