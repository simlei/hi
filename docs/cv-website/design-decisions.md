# Design Decisions

## Framework Choice: Next.js
- **Why?** 
  - Static site generation for fast loading
  - React ecosystem for rich interactivity
  - Built-in routing and optimization
  - Excellent GitHub Pages support
  - TypeScript integration

## UI Architecture
- **Component Design**
  - Modular, self-contained components
  - Canvas-based background animations
  - Intersection Observer for scroll effects
  - Headless UI for accessible dialogs

- **State Management**
  - Local React state for simplicity
  - No global state needed
  - Props for component configuration
  - React hooks for lifecycle management

## Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**
  - Muted professional palette
  - Subtle gradients for depth
  - High contrast for readability
  - Consistent brand colors

- **Typography**
  - Clear hierarchy
  - Professional font stack
  - Responsive sizing
  - Optimal line lengths

- **Animation Philosophy**
  - Subtle background movement
  - Smooth transitions
  - Intersection-based reveals
  - Performance-first approach

## Styling: TailwindCSS
- **Why?**
  - Utility-first for rapid development
  - JIT compilation for optimal output
  - Built-in responsive design
  - Easy dark mode support
  - Custom animation utilities

## Interactive Elements
- **Project Cards**
  - Hover effects for engagement
  - Modal dialogs for details
  - Smooth transitions
  - Lazy loading images

- **Graph Background**
  - Physics-based particle system
    * Velocity Verlet integration
    * Mass-based dynamics (0.8-1.2 units)
    * Air drag and damping
  - Force Field System
    * Hex grid structure (weight: 0.35)
    * Brownian motion (factor: 0.08)
    * Upward bias (0.2)
  - Network Effects
    * Dynamic edge connections
    * Wave-like pulse propagation
    * Activity spreading
  - Visual Optimization
    * GPU-accelerated canvas
    * Efficient data structures
    * Smooth color transitions
    * Responsive scaling
