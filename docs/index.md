# OpenHands Knowledge Base

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT FOR ALL SESSIONS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
All agents MUST:
1. Check this knowledge base first
2. Update the status file with their progress
3. Document any decisions or important findings
4. Review prompt at `/workspace/.oh/curriculum-vitae-prompt.txt`

## Quick Navigation

- [Current Status](/workspace/docs/STATUS.md) - Always check this first
- [CV Website Implementation](/workspace/docs/cv-website/README.md) - Documentation for CV website implementation
- [Development Scripts](/workspace/docs/cv-website/scripts.md) - Development and testing tools
- [Design Decisions](/workspace/docs/cv-website/design-decisions.md) - Key architectural choices
- [Build & Deploy](/workspace/docs/cv-website/build-deploy.md) - Build and deployment tools
- [Content Guidelines](/workspace/docs/cv-website/content.md) - CV and landing page content guidelines

## Tools Overview

1. Development Command (`website/scripts/dev.sh`)
   - Command dispatcher for development tasks
   - Environment and dependency management
   - Local toolchain with isolated environment
   - Automated dependency validation
   - Clean process handling

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Quick content updates: `dev.sh test --skip-runtime`
   - Component changes: `dev.sh test`
   - CI/deployment: `dev.sh test --ci`
   - Runtime error monitoring via `/workspace/.oh/current_error.txt`

3. Subcommands:
   - `server`: Development server with hot reload
   - `test`: Multi-level validation (build, static, runtime)
   - `exec`: Run commands in local environment
   - Common options: `--skip-build`, `--skip-runtime`, `--ci`

3. Deployment Tools
   - GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`)
   - Automated build and deployment to GitHub Pages
   - Content validation and artifact handling
   - Clean URLs without .html extension
   - No manual deployment needed

4. Development Features
   - Isolated local environment in `.local/`
   - Smart dependency management
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Hot module replacement
   - Comprehensive testing

## Documentation Structure

Each task or component has its own directory under `/workspace/docs/` with:
- README.md - Overview and getting started
- Specific documentation files for different aspects
- Task-specific guides and references

### Key Guidelines

1. [Bash Style Guide](/workspace/docs/bash_style.md)
   - Location-independent script execution
   - DRY principles and code reuse
   - Robust error handling
   - Common library structure
